# Express JWT Auth Note

**Note:**
So, right now, I'm using a simple in-memory array (`refreshTokens`) to handle refresh tokens. Just a heads-up, I plan to change this in the future. For a production setup, I'll definitely switch to a more secure and scalable storage solutionâ€”probably something like a database. Just wanted to keep you in the loop about the current setup and the future tweak on the horizon.
