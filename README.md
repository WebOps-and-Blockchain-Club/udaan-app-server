# Special Note
## Note:
Right now, I'm using a makeshift in-memory array (refreshTokens) for storing refresh tokens. But hey, plans are in motion! I'm definitely changing this up soon. For the real deal, especially in production, I'll be switching to a robust storage solution. Think databases, yeah! Just keeping you in the loop on the current setup and the imminent upgrade. ðŸ˜‰
